# QuRegDepCens
This repository contains code for performing quantile regression under dependent censoring with unknown association, corresponding to D'Haen, M., Van Keilegom, I., and Verhasselt, A. (2025). Quantile regression under dependent censoring with unknown association. *Lifetime Data Analysis*, 31(2):253--299.

Two scripts are available, providing examples of how the simulations for the mentioned paper were performed under the homoscedastic and heteroscedastic scenario. Please note that these serve the purpose of reproducibility only; a cleaner and more user-friendly implementation of the methodology is available in the R package `depCensoring` through [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/depCensoring/index.html).
